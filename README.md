# Capstone Project Update #2 of 2 – Web Development Project on GitHub

**Author:** Cason Robins  
**Course:** Web Development  
**Date:** November 2025  

## Project Overview

This repository contains my Web Development capstone project. The goal of the project is to practice professional site structure, clean HTML and CSS, basic JavaScript interactivity, and deployment using GitHub Pages. The site includes a home page, an about page, a products page, and a sitemap.

## Features

- Home page with a hero slideshow and navigation links  
- About page that explains the purpose of the capstone project and the technologies used  
- Products page that displays sample items in a clean, responsive layout  
- Sitemap page that lists all main files in the project for easy navigation  
- Shared styling using the external `styles.css` file  
- JavaScript interactivity through `app.js`  

## File Structure

All project files are stored in the root of the repository:

- `index.html` – Home page with slideshow  
- `Robins_Cason_CapstoneProject.html` – About page for the capstone project  
- `products.html` – Products listing page  
- `sitemap.html` – Sitemap page listing pages and key files  
- `styles.css` – Main stylesheet for layout and design  
- `app.js` – JavaScript for interactive features  
- `README.md` – Project overview and setup instructions  

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for page structure  
- CSS3 for layout and styling  
- JavaScript for interactivity  
- GitHub and GitHub Pages for version control and deployment
